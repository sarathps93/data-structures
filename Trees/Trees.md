# Trees

## Terminologies
root - the topmost node. There should be only one root
leaf - node with no children
Parent
Siblings
Edge - Connection between the nodes

## Conditions
1. All the nodes should point away from the root
2. Sibling nodes should not have connection between each other

## Applications
1. HTML DOM
2. Network Routing
3. Abstract Syntax Tree
4. Folders in an operating system
5. JSON

## Major types of trees
1. Binary Treas - Each node can have atmost 2 children
2. Binary search trees - Each node can have atmost 2 children and on top of that they are sorted in some order
Every node to the left should be always less than the parent node and every node to the right should be always greater than the parent node
3. Binary heaps
